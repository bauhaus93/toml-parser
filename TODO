DateTime:
    Check dates for validity (for now, any 2 digits for month/day/hour/min/sec are allowed)
Array Lexing:
    Maybe check better way for handling start condition of array.
    Is set to INITIAL after every each reading of a value, but needs to be set back to ARRAY and not INITIAL for correct lexing.
    Now done by setting condition to ARRAY after a comma is read.
